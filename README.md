==========

## Test Friday's Jade Rabbit clone moon rover.

1. Fork this project into your own github account as a public repo. 
1. Using the rpsec tests as a rough guide, write a feature or 
   features that tests the rover's existing functionality (we've added a 
   simple feature file to help get you started).  This should include
   all required step definitions.
1. Correct any errors or issues you find with the application or
   existing tests while you work. 
1. Show your work with regular, commented git commits. 
1. Make sure all tests pass. 
1. When you are done and are satisfied, send us the link to your public
   repo. 

Besides the basic test, think about what other aspects of the rover's behaviour
would you like to test. 

The test should take you no more than an hour.
